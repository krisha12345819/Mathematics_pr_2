# 📊 Expectation Decider – Probability & Statistics Project 🎯

> **"Turning Data into Decisions using Probability & Statistics"** ✨  

Welcome to the **Expectation Decider** project!  
This repository demonstrates how **probability theory** and **statistical analysis** can be applied to real student data to **predict exam outcomes** and understand **factors influencing success**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is part of an **academic case study (PR-2)** where we analyze a dataset of students and apply:

- 📈 Descriptive Statistics  
- 🎲 Probability Theory  
- 🧠 Conditional Probability  
- 🔁 Bayes Theorem  
- 🔵 Venn Diagrams  
- 📊 Contingency Tables  

The final goal is to **decide expectations** about whether a student is likely to **pass a competitive exam**.

## 📁 Dataset Information

📄 **Dataset File:**  
➡️ [`dataset.csv`](./dataset.csv)

### 🔍 Dataset Features

| Column Name | Description |
|------------|------------|
| `study_hours` | Hours studied per week |
| `attendance` | Attendance percentage |
| `group_discussion` | Participation (Yes/No) |
| `previous_test_score` | Marks out of 100 |
| `final_exam_pass` | Pass / Fail |

📌 Dataset is **AI-generated** but realistic and suitable for all required probability tasks.

### 🔹 7. Bayes Theorem 🧠✨

Used to calculate:

> **P(Pass | High Attendance)**  

Based on historical probabilities:
- High attendance among pass students
- High attendance among fail students
- Overall attendance rate
